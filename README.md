# Dijkstra-s_short_and_long
A program built in Python to use Dijkstra's path finding algorithm to find the shortest and attempt to find the longest. 


  **Finding the longest path is not NP complete and this part of the project was a demonstration of why this was a case.



  The Goal of this project was to Creat a small interface to find the shortest and the lognest path of a matrix supplied. Currently the matrix needs to be hard coded but could easily be added so that a user can imput this.
